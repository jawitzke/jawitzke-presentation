The flat stages are around 175-225 km and will typically end with a large bunch sprint with most of the overall contenders finishing together. Time Trials are much shorter stages and each individual rider rides seperately from everyone else. Riders are are on very areodynamic bikes that look very similar to triatholon bikes. These stages consist around 15-30 km and are done as fast as possible.
